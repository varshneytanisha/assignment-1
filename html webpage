        <h1>definition of photosynthesis</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. 
            Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water ‚Äì hence the name photosynthesis</p>
